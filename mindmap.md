## My Professional Learning Network (Mind-Map)
<br>
Throughout a Pre-Service Teacher’s Journey, it is essential to network with professional bodies, organizations, and colleagues in enhancing educational delivery and outcomes. Professional Learning Opportunities is an opportunity for teachers to share resources, ideas, and programs amongst staff and educational institutions. (AITSL,2022). For example, the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) has governed my practice as a Pre-Service Teacher by using this website to share my scaffolding steps and teaching resources with other Teachers for assessments and units of work within the Australian English Curriculum.

My Professional Learning Network Mind-Map identified below is a constructed accumulation of personal and professional resources that have developed my teaching practice. The mind-map is categorized into I.T and Digital Resources, Public Resources, and Community Networks (Both Professional and Personal).

 My practicum at low-socioeconomic schools has shaped my teaching pedagogy and attitude. I am happy to share and learn about new resources that benefit student learning. I am particularly attentive to adolescent cognitive development and how cognitive development interacts with student learning of concepts. Therefore, I lead my teaching practice through Bloom’s Taxonomy of Thinking which helps develop students’ understanding of concepts from Low Order Thinking Skills to Higher Order Thinking Skills. (Churchill, 2008). My time on practicum also exposed me to how accessible students are to global world issues through social media platforms and websites. Therefore, I have incorporated digital resources into classroom assessments to engage student interest and efficacy in completing assessment tasks.

In future practice, I am interested in using Digital Resources to aid students’ metacognitive understanding of texts through visual learning exercises. For example, students can engage in ‘See, Think, Wonder’ activities through digital devices, and it is helpful for students with learning difficulties.
